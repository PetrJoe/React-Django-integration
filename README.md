# Django and React Development Automation

This repository provides a custom `manage.py` script to streamline the development workflow for projects using Django as the backend framework and React as the frontend library. The script automates the setup of the React development server and ensures a smooth integration with the Django development server.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before using this script:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Django is a Python web framework)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Required for running the React development server)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PetrJoe/React-Django-integration.git
   ```

2. Replace the default `manage.py` script in your Django project with the provided customized version.

3. Install the required Node.js dependencies for the React project:

   ```bash
   cd React-Django-integration/frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Execute the custom `manage.py` script to start both the Django and React development servers simultaneously:

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

The script will automatically check if the React development server is running. If not, it will install the necessary dependencies and start the server. The Django development server will also be launched.

## Custom `manage.py` Script

The custom `manage.py` script provides the following features:

- Starts the React development server in a separate thread.
- Checks if the React server is already running to avoid redundant startups.
- Automatically installs Node.js dependencies and runs the React development server if not already running.

## Configuration

In your Django project's `settings.py` file, make sure the following settings are configured to handle static files generated by the React build process:

```python
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'frontend/dist/assets')]
STATIC_URL = '/assets/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

## Note
```README
	You have to change all the frontend to the name of your frontend folder inside manage.py file and settings.py where your static settings is located
```

## Both ReactJS and Django server run simultaneously on the same terminal 

Adjust these settings based on your project structure if needed.
